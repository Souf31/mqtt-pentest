# MQTT Pentest

The goal of this repo is to put some attack scenarios into practice. 
The repo is split in 4 parts for now, such as :

 - [Setup](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)
 - [Bruteforce](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)
 - [Denial of Service](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)
 - [TLS](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)

###

All this work was done on a  [Kali](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms)  VM up to date. We will use  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  for our MQTT Broker.

Some of these exercises are done using a **RaspBerry Pi** as an IoT device, but using **localhost** is also possible.

You should follow first the Setup subfolder to get a grasp of the MQTT protocol, then follow a guide if needed.

Each subfolder of this repo has its Readme, follow the instructions if you want to replicate the lab work.
